After I moved to Bengaluru to work in TI, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a multi-balcony apartment and I became very much interested in growing my own food and thought I will give it a try. So I went on Amazon one day and bought the whole shebang - pots, tools, soil mix and some seeds. In my very first attempt, I tried to grow coriander leaves and spinach. To my surprise, I did get a very nice crop and with this newfound confidence I started to expand crop list. I also tried growing chillies.

Then in the summer of 2023, I wanted to grow something bigger and then I realised tomatoes are fairly easy to grow and so I got some seeds of Indian round tomato and planted them. By this time, I did start composting my kitchen waste and that gave me some nutrient rich soil for my tomato plants. Tomato plants need plenty of sunlight to produce those delicious fruits but like any balcony plant, mine were only recieving limited golden light on a good day which led to small tomatoes as can be seen in the images. Nonetheless I was very happy to see those tomatoes. To me, a fruit dangling from a tree feels as beautiful as the prettiest flower any plant has ever produced.

*Pro-tip: If you are growing tomatoes, make sure your soil has the required amount of Calcium. Without calcium, the fruits' cells can't build strong cell walls which results in end rot. Do a quick search for "blossom end rot" to know more. Apparently this also happens to fruits like bell pepper and brinjal.*
