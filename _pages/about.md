#### Hello! :wave:

I'm currently working as a Digital Design Engineer at Texas Instruments in Bengaluru, India.  I am part of SoC team (within Radar R&D) that develops the digital sub-systems for integrated Radar SoCs.

Before joining TI, I completed my masters at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) (2019-22) where I worked with [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/sachin-patkar) for my M.Tech thesis, I worked on developing Hardware accelerator architectures for *Post-Quantum Cryptography* <!--(more on that here)-->. I also worked with [Prof. Biswa](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) on *randmoized cache security* <!--(more details here)-->. I graduated with B.Tech degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in) in 2019.

<!-- My research interests include hardware architecture for high performance computing and algorithm acceleration using HW/SW co-design. Recently I started diving into the area of EDA algorithm acceleration (such as RTL simulation/synthesis acceleration) using custom hardware or massively parallel systems. I came across some very interesting work on the same and I have tried to list them [here](/blogs/gardening).  -->

In my spare time, I enjoy reading about recent trends in tech and I also enjoy occasional [gardening](/blogs/gardening).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
